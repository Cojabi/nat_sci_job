The research-focused position will provide funding for seven (7) years that includes a salary and start-up package. Applicants will be expected to have an exceptional international research profile in any aspect related to genome function and/or gene expression demonstrated by high impact publications and the ability to attract competitive funding.\nLed by Professor David Tremethick, the overall aim of the Genome Biology Program is to understand the connection between genomes and phenotypes, and how this relationship is regulated in response to environmental and intrinsic signals crucial for cell development,\u00a0survival and homeostasis. This is being achieved\u00a0by combining experimental and computational approaches. Understanding this connection will uncover the aetiology of many diseases that involve individual genome differences and genome instability, which will have a direct impact on the new field of genomic medicine.\nUsing integrative genomic, genetic and biochemical approaches, our specific aims are:\n\nTo determine how the expression of genomic information is both regulated and integrated to create complex networks needed to direct biological processes including development and disease. We are investigating how the flow of information from the genome is regulated by its organisation into the epigenome. In particular, we are integrating the role of the epigenome with key signalling and transcription molecules and elucidating the regulatory architecture of gene expression. The development of new statistical models and approaches for genome-wide analyses are critical to achieve this aim.\nMost genomic regions can be actively transcribed leading to a myriad of distinct RNA molecules, some coding for proteins but most are likely to have diverse regulatory functions. We are decoding the principles of this RNA-level regulation, with an emphasis on the dynamic and highly combinatorial interactions of RNA with proteins to form functional ribonucleoprotein particles. Proteomic and transcriptomic measurements and their computational analysis are key to these activities.\u00a0\nTo uncover the various mechanisms of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation\u00a0mediated by chromatin, using model\u00a0organisms, different types of cellular\u00a0differentiation systems and in vitro transcription\u2013chromatin approaches. \u00a0\n\nIf you have the high-level experience and qualifications necessary to succeed and are keen to join our Department we would welcome your application.

We study the molecular interactions underlying the formation of membrane-less organelles such as stress\u00a0granules and nuclear speckles. It has recently become clear that many membrane-less organelles have liquid droplet properties, and are formed through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). We have recently proposed that stress granules are formed through LLPS and that stress granule components can undergo LLPS in vitro (Molliex et al. Cell 2015). We have also demonstrated that the ubiquitin ligase component SPOP, a tumor suppressor that is mutated frequently in cancers, is recruited to liquid nuclear compartments, and forms large oligomers with high ubiquitination activity (Marzahn et al. EMBO J 2016). We are interested in the following questions: Which molecular interactions drive protein assembly into liquid droplets? What is the impact of confining an enzyme into a dense droplet? What is the mechanistic link of membrane-less organelles with neurodegenerative\u00a0disease\u00a0and cancer?\u00a0We use a combination of biophysical (e.g. NMR spectroscopy, other high-resolution structural techniques,and scattering approaches), biochemical and cell culture approaches to gain mechanistic insights into function and disease. We collaborate with several other leading laboratories in the field. Project opportunities will be discussed during the selection process.\u00a0The selected candidate will be part of a fast-paced work environment and work closely with all members of the lab team, including the lab head, performing a variety of diverse experimental duties and data analysis. These duties will include bacterial cell culture, molecular biology tasks, protein purification and characterization with the ultimate goal of driving biophysical and biochemical analysis.\u00a0The associate scientist focuses on one or more specific scientific endeavors of the laboratory as directed by the lab head, and utilizes unique, advanced skills in achieving the highest research goals. The associate scientist develops new experimental procedures and publishes research results. He or she initiates and conducts independent experiments without direct supervision, assists with the management of laboratory operations, and performs other related duties as assigned or directed in order to meet the goals and objectives of the department\u00a0and the institution.Minimum Education:Bachelor's degree in an appropriate scientific field is required.Minimum Experience:A minimum of fifteen (15) years of relevant post-degree work experience is required with a Bachelor's degree, with at least seven (7) years at the Research Lab Specialist levelA minimum of fourteen (14) years of relevant post-degree work experience is required with a Master's degree, with at least seven (7) years at the Research Lab Specialist levelA minimum of nine (9) years of relevant work experience including post-doctoral and/or technical staff experience is required with Ph.D.EEO:St. Jude is an Equal Opportunity EmployerNot ready to apply?

Programmed DNA elimination is a developmental process in which portions of the genome are reproducibly eliminated. This process occurs in diverse eukaryotes ranging from single-celled ciliates, nematodes, and crustaceans to birds and jawless \ufb01sh (lampreys). In some nematodes, ~15% of the genome is eliminated in the somatic lineages during the 3rd through 5th cleavage (4 to 16 cell stage), while the germline genome remains intact. ~1000 germline and early development expressed genes are eliminated.\u00a0 Chromosomes break, regions are lost, and new and increased numbers of chromosomes are formed. Areas under investigation include analysis in nematodes of 1) how genome regions are marked for retention or elimination, 2) how break regions are identified and the mechanism of chromosome breaks, 3) how eliminated chromosome regions are selectively lost from holocentric chromosomes, and 4) the contributions of epigenetic factors including histone modifications and non-coding RNAs to DNA elimination.\nFor additional information on the laboratory's research and recent publications, see http://140.226.65.22/Davis_lab/index.html\nThe University of Colorado School of Medicine is located in a brand-new, state-of-the-art facility on the Anschutz Medical Campus.

The successful candidate will have outstanding skills in bioinformatics and statistics and a driving curiosity about how genes affect behavior and other complex traits. The position may be held with Dr. Mark Reimers at Michigan State University in East Lansing, or with Dr. Kenneth Kendler at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond.\nThe project aims to address a fundamental question in the genetics of complex traits and diseases: to what extent do genetic variants related to a trait point to a distinct molecular mechanism for that trait? We will specifically compare the genetics of a variety of behavioral traits and psychiatric disorders to the genetics of well-understood processes like growth, and to the genetics of other well-studied complex traits and diseases.\nWe will have access to many of the largest GWAS data sets compiled to date, and we will integrate these GWAS data with several kinds of genomic data: chromatin, 17-primate conservation, and population history, in order to identify lists of the most likely candidate SNPs and genes. We will then map genes to the rapidly expanding protein-interaction and cell signaling databases in order to identify interactions among the proteins coded by these genes. Then we will develop metrics to quantify the molecular coherence of various traits: that is, the extent to which the different genes implicated in each trait interact directly with each other; this metric will be analogous to network connectivity, although edges may have different strengths or types.\u00a0Much of this project will depend on integrating data which comes with considerable uncertainty, and we plan to use a Bayesian approach.\nThis unique integrative project will require a comprehensive engagement with a variety of GWAS data, and draw on a large swathe of modern computational molecular biology; we expect it to yield significant insight into how common genetic variation may influence many complex human traits, and therefore to high-profile publications.\u00a0This position is funded by a grant from the Templeton Foundation.\nApplication Process:\nInterested applicants should send applications to Dr Mark Reimers (reimersm@msu.edu), or to Dr. Kenneth Kendler, (kenneth.kendler@vcuhealth.org), with subject heading \u2018Templeton post-doc application\u2019.

This position will build on nascent research that has begun to develop the conceptual underpinnings for defining the \u2018natural capital component\u2019 of relevant goals and will test that framework by quantifying the role of nature in achieving a selection of the goals and/or their underlying targets, at the global scale, complemented by appropriate national scale case studies. Such an approach is critical to understand, for example, the degree of dependence of many of the goals and targets on natural capital for their achievement, as well as the spatial distribution of ecosystems most critical for providing the associated ecosystem benefits. This approach will permit the exploration of inevitable trade-offs between goals and targets as they interact over space and time, in order to assess sustainability through 2030 and beyond.\nThe Fellow\u2019s work will have the potential to impact global-scale policy interventions and instruments, including processes such as IPBES, and will also be critical for informing \u201cnationalization\u201d of the SDGs; how should individual countries integrate the role of nature as they each define and implement a pathway to achieving the SDGs over the next few years.
