To do so, the Foundation proactively initiates and supports research across the entire treatment development continuum, while working to eliminate barriers and create efficiencies to speed the pace of progress\nSince 2007, when virtually nothing was known about the disease, the Foundation has built a vibrant research community, developed centralized repositories of tumor and preclinical models, and supported over 100 research projects in labs across the world. This has resulted in a dramatic increase in the understanding of chordoma biology, discovery of a number of therapeutic targets, and identification of promising treatments that show activity in preclinical models. Based on these findings, the Foundation is working with over a dozen companies to repurpose existing therapies or develop new therapies for chordoma. The result is a growing pipeline of clinical trials, including six that will be open by 2017, and a goal of ten by 2020.\nThe Foundation\u2019s success in catalyzing research has been repeatedly recognized by\u00a0FasterCures, The National Cancer Institute, ABC News, BioCentury and The Atlantic, to name a few.\u00a0 And, its Executive Director, Josh\u00a0Sommer, was twice named by Forbes as one of the \u201c30 under 30\u201d transforming the field of\u00a0science and healthcare.\nTo date, the Foundation has invested nearly $5M in research and has leveraged well over $20M in outside funding.

We study the molecular interactions underlying the formation of membrane-less organelles such as stress\u00a0granules and nuclear speckles. It has recently become clear that many membrane-less organelles have liquid droplet properties, and are formed through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). We have recently proposed that stress granules are formed through LLPS and that stress granule components can undergo LLPS in vitro (Molliex et al. Cell 2015). We have also demonstrated that the ubiquitin ligase component SPOP, a tumor suppressor that is mutated frequently in cancers, is recruited to liquid nuclear compartments, and forms large oligomers with high ubiquitination activity (Marzahn et al. EMBO J 2016). We are interested in the following questions: Which molecular interactions drive protein assembly into liquid droplets? What is the impact of confining an enzyme into a dense droplet? What is the mechanistic link of membrane-less organelles with neurodegenerative\u00a0disease\u00a0and cancer?\u00a0We use a combination of biophysical (e.g. NMR spectroscopy, other high-resolution structural techniques,and scattering approaches), biochemical and cell culture approaches to gain mechanistic insights into function and disease.

Recognizing the unprecedented environmental and social changes on our planet, she called for scientists to be more effective at sharing new and existing knowledge to decision-makers and the public. In 1999, motivated by this call for action, COMPASS was founded to support scientists in their efforts to communicate. The organization provides strategic and practical support for scientists to engage without compromising the accuracy and credibility of their science.\nIn the early days, COMPASS focused on supporting ocean scientists, helping elevate their understanding about topics like marine protected areas and the decline of marine fisheries. Since then the organization has continued to evolve, pioneering new ways to help scientists engage with the wider world. COMPASS has expanded its scope beyond oceans, to work on a variety of topics about people and the environment such as water, wildfire, ecosystem services, and climate adaptation, while constantly expanding its networks.\nCOMPASS works to empower scientists to help frame and advance their engagement in critical conservation policy issues and to support scientists in thinking with an ecosystem-based mindset. The COMPASS team has trained thousands of scientists to be strong and relevant communicators, ready to engage with multiple audiences.\u00a0 COMPASS has supported scientists studying topics like fisheries, ocean acidification and ecosystem based management, to help get issues on the public agenda, by training scientists to communicate complex concepts in relevant and accessible (yet still accurate) ways and connecting scientists to agenda setting media. COMPASS hosts journalist fellowships for scientific societies so journalists can attend scientific conferences to meet scientists and learn about emerging science. The COMPASS team has supported scientists to meet with key policy actors across federal and state governments from agencies, the White House, and Congressional and state legislative offices. These engagements, ranging from ecosystem services to wildfire to water sustainability, have led to framing and advancing new approaches to policies and practices. COMPASS does not advocate or work towards specific policy outcomes. The organization believes that when scientific knowledge and insights are at the table, emerging solutions will be more robust and benefit both for people and the ecosystems that serve them.\nIn the past year, the Board and staff have been reviewing the way COMPASS has expanded its work to reach a widening network of policy makers at the state and federal level, while continuing to broker relationships between scientists and journalists in a changing media landscape.\u00a0\nCOMPASS is a distributed organization with 15 staff located across the country (with two main offices in Washington, D.C. and Portland Oregon). The team consists of field leaders (who have worked as scientists, journalists or policy staff), who have pioneered approaches to support and connect scientists, and who have written seminal pieces (books and articles) about science communication. COMPASS\u2019 annual budget is approximately $2,000,000/year, and continues to grow each year. COMPASS is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt non-profit.\nFor more information about COMPASS, please visit the website and blog: www.compassonline.org and compassblogs.org.\nAbout the Position\nThe new Executive Director will be passionate about COMPASS\u2019 mission and align with the organization\u2019s core beliefs and values.

These observations are the basis for the concepts of penetrance and expressivity. Although factors thought to contribute to variability of phenotype include modifier genes (intrinsic factors), environmental influences (extrinsic factors) and acquired changes over time (somatic variation), our current knowledge remains limited regarding what drives penetrance and expression.\nWe wish to explore the factors that contribute to phenotypic variability through studying cellular models of rare disorders with variable expressivity. We are generating human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from patients, and will explore different cell-types obtained through directed differentiation of these iPS cells. In parallel we will also explore CRISPR/CAS-9 edited cell lines of the same genes, enabling us to contrast how patient-derived iPS cells differ from engineered iPS cells\nThe outcomes of this project will also help to address whether iPS cells can be more broadly applied for the purpose of understanding of phenotypic variability of rare disorders.\nEssential Skills\n\nPhD in a relevant subject area (Statistics, Computational Biology, Population Genetics/Genomics, Computer Science, Physics)\nStrong statistical and quantitative skills\nStrong publishing record\nExcellent programming skills (both interpreted and compiled languages e.g. C/Fortran + Perl/Python/Ruby)\nFamiliarity with statistical modeling and software\nExtensive experience of UNIX/Linux and cluster computing\nExperience with very large data sets\nExtensive experience of communicating effectively internally at all levels and with select external individuals\nAbility to communicate ideas and results effectively\nAbility to work independently and organise own workload\n\nIdeal Skills\n\nExperience with analysis of -omics data sets\u00a0\nPrevious experience with QTL analysis\u00a0\nPrevious experience with stem cells\u00a0\nSome understanding of genomics assays (RNA-seq, ChIP, genome sequencing) would be advantageous\u00a0\n\nOther information\nA detailed role profile and further information regarding the new program can be found on our website at:\u00a0http://www.sanger.ac.uk/\nThe Sanger Institute is a charitably funded research centre focused on understanding the role of genetics in health and disease.

The position may be held with Dr. Mark Reimers at Michigan State University in East Lansing, or with Dr. Kenneth Kendler at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond.\nThe project aims to address a fundamental question in the genetics of complex traits and diseases: to what extent do genetic variants related to a trait point to a distinct molecular mechanism for that trait? We will specifically compare the genetics of a variety of behavioral traits and psychiatric disorders to the genetics of well-understood processes like growth, and to the genetics of other well-studied complex traits and diseases.\nWe will have access to many of the largest GWAS data sets compiled to date, and we will integrate these GWAS data with several kinds of genomic data: chromatin, 17-primate conservation, and population history, in order to identify lists of the most likely candidate SNPs and genes. We will then map genes to the rapidly expanding protein-interaction and cell signaling databases in order to identify interactions among the proteins coded by these genes. Then we will develop metrics to quantify the molecular coherence of various traits: that is, the extent to which the different genes implicated in each trait interact directly with each other; this metric will be analogous to network connectivity, although edges may have different strengths or types.\u00a0Much of this project will depend on integrating data which comes with considerable uncertainty, and we plan to use a Bayesian approach.\nThis unique integrative project will require a comprehensive engagement with a variety of GWAS data, and draw on a large swathe of modern computational molecular biology; we expect it to yield significant insight into how common genetic variation may influence many complex human traits, and therefore to high-profile publications.\u00a0This position is funded by a grant from the Templeton Foundation.\nApplication Process:\nInterested applicants should send applications to Dr Mark Reimers (reimersm@msu.edu), or to Dr. Kenneth Kendler, (kenneth.kendler@vcuhealth.org), with subject heading \u2018Templeton post-doc application\u2019.
